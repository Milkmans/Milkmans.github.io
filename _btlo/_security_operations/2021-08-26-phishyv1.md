## Walkthrough

With this investigation we are given a note titled "PHISHY V1 READ ME.txt" which is located on the system's Desktop. Said note, gives us a URL to investigate with simply a browser (Firefox).

### Investigate the Website 

Traversing to the provided URL "securedocument[.]net/secure/L0GIN/protected/login/portal/index1.html?1614546319649" via the Firefox browser, we can immediately see what appears to be an Office 365 logon page - reference Fig.2.

Taking a look the sourcecode of the webpage, we identified a PHP file titled <ins>"jeff.php"</ins> which appears to take the input from the <I>"Email ID"</I> and <I>"Email Password"</I> fields identified on the webpage. The data from both of these fields appears to be assigned to the variables <I>"userrr"</I> and <I>"passss"</I> respectively.
