## Walkthrough

With this investigation we are given a note titled "PHISHY V1 READ ME.txt" which is located on the system's Desktop. Said note, gives us a URL to investigate with simply a browser (Firefox).

### Investigate the Website 

Traversing to the provided URL "securedocument[.]net/secure/L0GIN/protected/login/portal/index1.html?1614546319649" via the Firefox browser, we can immediately see what appears to be an Office 365 logon page - reference Fig.2.

<i>Fig.2</i>

Taking a look the sourcecode of the webpage, we identified a PHP file titled "<ins>jeff.php</ins>" which appears to take the input from the <i>"Email ID"</i> and <i>"Email Password"</i> fields identified on the webpage. The data from both of these fields appears to be assigned to the variables <i>"userrr"</i> and <i>"passss"</i> respectively.

  <i>jeff.php</i>
</details>
{: .notice--info}

Reviewing the PHP file "<i>jeff.php</i>" we can see that it appears to build an email template with the body containing the email and password data passed to it from the "<i>Email ID</i>" and "<i>Email Password</i>" fields previously identified. However, this will throw an error because the variable "<i>user1</i>" and "<i>pass1</i>" are not properly defined. If we reference Fig.3, we can see that the <i>likely</i> fields meant for this were "<i>userrr</i>" and "<i>passss</i>." Additionally, we can see that if the PHP page was properly set up, it would send the passed data to "<ins>boris.smets@tfl-uk.co</ins>" and then redirect the user/victim to "<ins>https://www.Office.com/</ins>"
