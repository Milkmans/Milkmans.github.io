### Investigate the Website 

Traversing to the provided URL "securedocument[.]net/secure/L0GIN/protected/login/portal/index1.html?1614546319649" via the Firefox browser, we can immediately see what appears to be an Office 365 logon page - reference Fig.2.

<i>Fig.2</i>

Taking a look the sourcecode of the webpage, we identified a PHP file titled "<ins>jeff.php</ins>" which appears to take the input from the <i>"Email ID"</i> and <i>"Email Password"</i> fields identified on the webpage. The data from both of these fields appears to be assigned to the variables <i>"userrr"</i> and <i>"passss"</i> respectively.
