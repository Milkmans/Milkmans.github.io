## Walkthrough

With this investigation we are given a note titled "PHISHY V1 READ ME.txt" which is located on the system's Desktop. Said note, gives us a URL to investigate with simply a browser (Firefox).

### Investigate the Website 

Traversing to the provided URL "securedocument[.]net/secure/L0GIN/protected/login/portal/index1.html?1614546319649" via the Firefox browser, we can immediately see what appears to be an Office 365 logon page - reference Fig.2.

<i>Fig.2</i>

Taking a look the sourcecode of the webpage, we identified a PHP file titled "<ins>jeff.php</ins>" which appears to take the input from the <i>"Email ID"</i> and <i>"Email Password"</i> fields identified on the webpage. The data from both of these fields appears to be assigned to the variables <i>"userrr"</i> and <i>"passss"</i> respectively.

  <i>jeff.php</i>
</details>
{: .notice--info}

Reviewing the PHP file "<i>jeff.php</i>" we can see that it appears to build an email template with the body containing the email and password data passed to it from the "<i>Email ID</i>" and "<i>Email Password</i>" fields previously identified. However, this will throw an error because the variable "<ins>user1</ins>" (reference fig.3:line 8 of jeff.php) and "<ins>pass1</ins>" (reference fig.3:line 9 of jeff.php) are not properly defined. If we reference Fig.3, we can see that the <i>likely</i> fields meant for this were "<ins>userrr</ins>" (reference fig.3:line 15 of index1.html) and "<ins>passss</ins>." (reference fig.3:line 16 of index1.html)  Additionally, we can see that if the PHP page were properly set up, it would send the passed data to "<ins>boris.smets@tfl-uk.co</ins>" (reference fig.3:line 11 of jeff.php) and then redirect the user/victim to "<ins>https://www.Office.com/</ins>." (reference fig.3:line 21 of jeff.php)

Traversing the additional directories of the website there were some additional items of interest. The first item is the "Portal" page, there is JS code that shows how the "index1.html" page and query string are defined. This value is set via "index1.html?'+new Date().<ins>getTime()</ins>" which defines the page as "index1.html" and creates an query of the epoch timestamp of the date/time the page was accessed.
